title: "利用R做数据清洗"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Ground rules
1. tbl is a better visulizaion tool than dataframe.
2. View() is a function to extract data in a readable way.
```{r tbl}
View(iris)
```
3. The pipe opeator
```{r}
library(dplyr)
tb %>% select(child:elderly)
```
# Goals of data wrangling
1. make data suitable to use with particular pirce of softwasre
2. reveal information

# Dataset used in the tutorial
```{r}
library(EDAWR)
?pollution
?cases # TB cases in different countries.
?tb # dataset with tb diseases.
View(tb)
storms$storm
storms$wind
storms
cases$country
names(cases)[-1] # select except first one.
unlist(cases[1:3, 2:4])
cases[1:3] # select rows
cases[1:3]
```
# tidy data
1. each variable is saved in its own column.
2. each observation is saved in its own row.
3. each type of observation stored in a single table.
# tidyr
## two main functions
gather()
spread()
```{r}
library(tidyr)
?gather
gather(cases, "year", "n", 2:4) # key,value, 
```
```{r}
cases
```

```{r}
spread(pollution, size, amount)
```

```{r}
pollution
```

## spread(data, key, value)
1. each unique value in the key column becomes a column name
2. each value in value column becaomes a cell in the new columns.

## gather(data, new key, new value, indexes to collapse.)
## unite and separate
```{r}
separate(storms, date, c("y", "m", "d"), sep = "-")
```

```{r}
unite(storms, "wp", wind, pressure, sep = "-")
```

# tidyr
1. observation -> variables gather
2. varaible -> observations spread
3. split seperate
4. merge unite

# dplyr
```{r}
library(dplyr)
?select
?filter
?arrange
?mutate
?summarise
?group_by
```

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
?airlines
?airports
?flights
```

# ways to access information
1. extract existing variables.
2. extract existing observations.
3. derive new variables?
4. change the unit of analysis.

```{r access variables}
select(storms, storm, pressure)
```
```{r slect using minus mark}
select(storms, -storm)
select(storms, wind:date)
```

```{r}
filter(storms, wind>=50)
```

```{r}
filter(storms, wind>=50,
       storm %in% c("Alex", "Ana", "Allison"))
```

```{r}
mutate(storms, ratio = pressure / wind)
```

```{r}
mutate(storms, ratio = pressure / wind, inverse = ratio^-1)
```

```{r}
summarise(pollution, median(amount), variance = var(amount))
```
```{r}
pollution %>% summarise(mean(amount), sum(amount), n())
```

```{r}
arrange(storms, wind)
```

```{r}
arrange(storms, desc(wind))
```

```{r}
arrange(storms, wind, date)
```

```{r}
tb %>% select(child:elderly)
```

```{r}
select(storms, storm, pressure)
storms %>% select(storm, pressure)
```

```{r}
storms %>% filter(wind>=50) %>% select(storm, pressure)
```

```{r}
# short cut for %>% cmd shift M
storms %>% 
  mutate(ratio = pressure / wind) %>% 
  select(storm, ratio)
```

```{r}
pollution %>% group_by(city)
```
```{r}
pollution %>% group_by(city) %>% 
  summarise(mean(amount), sum(amount), n())
```

```{r}
pollution %>% group_by(city) %>% summarise(mean(amount))
```

```{r}
pollution %>% ungroup()
```
# join data

# best format for analysis
1. variables in columns
2. obsevations in rows
3. seperatet all variables implied by law, formula or goal
4. unit of analysis matches the unit of analysis implied by law, formula, or goal.
5. single table.
